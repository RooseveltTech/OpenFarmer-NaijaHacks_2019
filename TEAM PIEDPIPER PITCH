# The Problem 

Our Country Nigeria is a third-world country, with a poverty rate percentage of 46.5% which accounts half of the citizens living in Penury. Nigeria has about 34 solid mineral resources which are poorly managed by the government and public staff and this has an evident heavy impact on our economy bringing deficiency in the economic growth (low GDP, inflation, currency devaluation). 
With the Crude Oil boom in 1970, monopoly of the Crude Oil brought about the infertility of other natural resources.  Agriculture which was
the primary source of the welfare of the Nation and since after 1999 the monopoly of the Crude Oil started to cripple the economy. 
Furthermore, due to the unmanaged agencies of Agriculture the citizen lost interests in their primary source of survival with led to th
e declining economy of the country coming with different diseases like high death rate, llow job creations, poverty, high crime rate, 
illiteracy (due to non-affordable fees), and many others.

#Challenges

Its been challenging knowing the fact, not everyone can afford to go to school or in fact get a white collar Job after graduation.
People have started falling back to their first love (Agriculture).   In the real sense, the practice of this Agriculture is as a
result of survival instincts and these practices lack the skills to grow and survive because 80% of the farmers practicing are illiterates
and they don’t have the resources or demanding information to improve these practices.

#Proposed Solutions

If 80% percent of the Nigerians Farmers are illiterates, this implies the poor and inefficient practices of Agriculture in the country
which leads us to a proposed solution.
Our proposed Solution is to tackle the issue of Illiteracy and Job creation which will strengthen the nation’s economy to the poor 
citizen’s advantage. OpenFarmer is a crowdsourcing solution aimed at providing local farmers an intuitive access to information.
A project to help farmers and agricultural researchers exchange ideas, foster collaboration between the two players and provide 
sustainable agricultural practices. 

#Impact

There is no doubt this would impact us in so many ways. When the primary issues have been dealt with, other secondary issues would fall
in place. Having said so, Open-Farmer has no restriction to any citizen, as the only prerequisite for using this platform is if you’re
ready at any time to farm. When resourceful information are advised by experts and people are able to improve their crop yields, over a
short period of time, the dependency of Crude Oil to feed us will drastically reduce hereby the diversification of natural resources 
would be tangible leading to the strengthening of the National economy leading also to steady money circulation, providing jobs and so
many positives.

#Future Plans

Our future plans for this project is to localize this crowdsourcing platform for all Nigerian languages, also implementation further
implementation of voice recognition to search for information and fetch these information without having to type anything on the
platform. 
This project has also planned the integration of collaboration of farmers and experts in practicing shared profits.
